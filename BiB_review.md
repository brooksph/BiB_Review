#### Body

* Need for training in computational biology 

	* Data suggests that a lack of training, not resources, is the barrier to computation in the hands of biologists (Kumar and Dudley, 2007). 
	* Difficulty integrating into curriculum at any level (Wilson 2016)
		* What level? High school, undergrad, graduate school? 
		* Who should teach? Biologists v computer scientists 
		* What department would host this? Biologists think computer scientists and computer scientists don't believe this information warrants a credit. 

* The Role of Software Carpentry and Data Carpentry in training computational biologists 
	* What are the missions of these organizations?
		* Software carpentry - to teach computational competence - not specific tools 
		* Data carpentry - teaching scientists basic skills for retrieving, viewing, managing, and manipulating data in an open and reproducible way
			* Both organizations are seeking make it easier for researchers to utilize tools for data analysis and to enhance reproducibility by introducing researchers to methods for carrying this out. 
			* Addressing the need to scale up bioinformatics training. 
	
	
	* Target populations 
		* (@ PTB - Not sure) - Researchers at all levels. The goal is cover topics required for efficient and reproducible data analysis based upon a community consensus. 
		
	
	
	* Strategies 
		* Collaborative lesson plan development
		* Volunteer teachers 
		
	
	* Evolution - Software carpentry (older) v Data Carpentry (new) 
		* Three iterations of software carpentry; started in 1998
			* Major obstacles to getting off the ground in iteration 1 and 2
				* Five day workshops would not scale well. 
				* A single instructor cannot reach enough people
				* Cobbling together funding from mutilple sources is difficult and distracting 
			* Some improvements in 3rd iteration 
				* Moving from 1 week to 2 day workshop increased participation 
				* Obtaining grant from sloan foundation decreased focus juggling funding from different organizations 
				* Moved toward higher level concepts 
					* Unix shell 
					* Programming in Pyton, R, or Matlab 
					* Version control 
					* More programming or databases 
				
			* Have outside contributions increased? 
			
		* Data carpentry - Origin 2014 (@PTB verify date of origin) 
	
	* Topics covered

#### To do: 

* What is data science? 
	* Integrates knowledge from many fields including Biology, Computer science, chemistry, biology, pharmacology, agriculture,  etc. 
* What are the current challenges in data science? 
* How are data carpentry and software carpentry addressing these challenges? 
* What are the skills required by a bioinformatician? 
	* The ability to integrate knowledge from different fields to address questions in Biology (Orozco et al. 2013). 
* Is either software carpentry of Data Carpentry an international organization? 
* Does either organization have close affiliates/partners that help them accomplish their mission/goals? 
* What is mission of Software Carpentry? Data Carpentry? 
	* Software carpentry - to teach computational competence - not specific tools 
	* Data carpentry - teaching scientists basic skills for retrieving, viewing, managing, and manipulating data in an open and reproducible way
	
* How has either organization overcome technological barriers? 
* How has either organization addressed increasing the number of underrepresented minorities in computational biology? 
* Impact in the US versus developing countries? 
* What are some tools/technologies that have been essential for carrying out the missions of these organizations? Any new technologies on the horizon? 
* Strategies (Maybe a good name for a section?)
* What role does "open science" play? 
* Impacts on reproducibility? 
* Evidence that either organization is enhancing the quality of research products? 
* Do they charge participants 
	* Software carpentry - Sometimes; 20-40$. Charging decreases no*shows from ~1/3 to ~%5.
