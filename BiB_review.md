			* Moved toward higher level concepts 
				* Unix shell 
				* Programming in Pyton, R, or Matlab 
				* Version control 
				* More programming or databases

#### To do: 

* What is data science? 
	* Integrates knowledge from many fields including Biology, Computer science, chemistry, biology, pharmacology, agriculture,  etc. 
* What are the current challenges in data science? 
* How are data carpentry and software carpentry addressing these challenges? 
* What are the skills required by a bioinformatician? 
	* The ability to integrate knowledge from different fields to address questions in Biology (Orozco et al. 2013). 
* Is either software carpentry of Data Carpentry an international organization? 
* Does either organization have close affiliates/partners that help them accomplish their mission/goals? 
* What is mission of Software Carpentry? Data Carpentry? 
	* Software carpentry - to teach computational competence - not specific tools 
	* Data carpentry - teaching scientists basic skills for retrieving, viewing, managing, and manipulating data in an open and reproducible way
	
* How has either organization overcome technological barriers? 
* How has either organization addressed increasing the number of underrepresented minorities in computational biology? 
* Impact in the US versus developing countries? 
* What are some tools/technologies that have been essential for carrying out the missions of these organizations? Any new technologies on the horizon? 
* Strategies (Maybe a good name for a section?)
* What role does "open science" play? 
* Impacts on reproducibility? 
* Evidence that either organization is enhancing the quality of research products? 
* Do they charge participants 
	* Software carpentry - Sometimes; 20-40$. Charging decreases no*shows from ~1/3 to ~%5.
